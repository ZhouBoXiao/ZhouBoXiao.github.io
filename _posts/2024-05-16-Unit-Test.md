# Types of Testing

Spring Boot applications can be tested at various levels, including:

1. Unit Testing: Testing individual components, such as classes or methods, in isolation.
2. Integration Testing: Verifying that different components or services work correctly together.
3. Functional Testing: Testing the application’s functionality from the user’s perspective.
4. End-to-End Testing: Testing the entire application, including its external dependencies, in a production-like environment.

# Spring Test

##  Leverage Spring Boot’s Testing Annotations

1. Use `@SpringBootTest` to load the entire Spring context.

```java
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
class TestingWebApplicationTest {

	@Autowired
	private MockMvc mockMvc;

	@Test
	void shouldReturnDefaultMessage() throws Exception {
		this.mockMvc.perform(get("/")).andDo(print()).andExpect(status().isOk())
				.andExpect(content().string(containsString("Hello, World")));
	}
}
```

2. Use  `MockMvc` to simulate HTTP requests and test the response from your controller. Use `@AutoConfigureMockMvc` to automatically configure `MockMvc`

3. Use `@MockBean` to replace a real bean with a mock implementation.

   > `@Mock` vs `@MockBean`:
   > 
   > `@Mock` is used for unit testing and mocking objects outside of the Spring context, while `@MockBean` is used for Spring Boot integration testing to replace real beans with mock or spy versions within the Spring application context.

4. Use `@DataJpaTest` to test repositories with an embedded database.

5. Use @AutoConfigureTestDatabase to configure the test database.
   
6. Use @BeforeEach and @AfterEach to set up and tear down test fixtures.
```
@BeforeEach
  public void setUp() {
    // Initialize the EmployeeService or set up resources if needed
    employeeService = new EmployeeService();    
  }
  
  @AfterEach
  public void tearDown() {
    // Clean up resources or perform other cleanup tasks
    employeeService = null;
  }
```
## Test Configuration
1. Use @TestConfiguration to provide additional beans for testing.
	i. Create a static inner class in the same test class where we want to autowire the bean.
	ii. Create a separate test configuration class and import it using the @Import annotation.

2. Use @ConfigurationProperties to inject properties from a configuration file.
3. Use @ActiveProfiles to activate a specific profile for testing when you have multiple profiles.
4. Use @DynamicPropertySource to set dynamic configuration properties for tests.
5. Use @DirtiesContext to reset the Spring context after a test.
   1. @DirtiesContext通常用于测试方法对Spring应用程序上下文有副作用，不能通过常规事务或回滚机制撤消的情况。
   2. 就性能而言，重置应用程序上下文的代价相对较高，因此要谨慎使用。
6. Use RestTemplate to make HTTP requests.
7. Use @SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT) to start the server on a random port. Use TestRestTemplate to make HTTP requests and assert responses.
8. Use @Sql to execute SQL scripts before and after a test.
9. Use @Disabled to disable a test temporarily.
10. Use @RepeatedTest to repeat a test a specified number of times.


# Testing Frameworks
There are several testing tools commonly used in Spring Boot applications, including:

- JUnit: A widely-used testing framework for Java.
- Mockito: A mocking framework for creating mock objects in tests.
- Testcontainers: Provides lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases or services for testing.
- Spring Boot Test: Offers annotations and utilities for testing Spring Boot applications.
- RestAssured: A Java DSL for simplifying the testing of REST services.
- Selenium: Used for web application testing, especially end-to-end testing.
- Jacoco: A code coverage analysis tool that helps you identify areas of your codebase that need more testing.
- WireMock: A tool for mocking HTTP services, useful for testing external service interactions.
